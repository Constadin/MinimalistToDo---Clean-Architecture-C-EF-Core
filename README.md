# MinimalistToDo

MinimalistToDoList is a simple yet fully structured task management application built with Clean Architecture principles.

## Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET 9
- Entity Framework Core (EF Core)
- In-Memory Database for rapid prototyping

## Architecture
- Implements strict separation of concerns across layers:
  - Core
  - Application
  - Infrastructure
  - UI

## Features
- Asynchronous data access with EF Core
- Dependency Injection throughout for enhanced modularity, testability, and maintainability
- Use of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and mapping patterns to ensure clear and decoupled data flow
- Data seeding for quick startup and testing

## What This Project Demonstrates
- A scalable and maintainable architectural pattern ideal for professional-grade applications
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code following best practices in software design
- Effective management of asynchronous data operations and dependencies
- Practical application of SOLID principles and clean coding standards
